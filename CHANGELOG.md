## Version 0.2.1- November 24, 2025
* Bug fixing, improvements and new features:

- This version has several improvements in anti-spoofing techniques:

- Anti-Spoofing Result Map
- Screen Glare Detection
- Motion Correlation Check
- Face Contour Analysis (Mask Detection)
- Details:
- Bug fixing: Ignoring wrong error message (errorProcessing) after session.isComplete. 
- Bug fixing: Fixing glare detection method and adding option to enable/disable it. 
- Improving verifyMotionCorrelation method. Now checking both X and Y axes. 
- Adding params to enable/disable motion correlation detection. 
- Adding mask detection feature by detection face contours (The user can choose to enable/disable this feature, as well as the number of contours detected. The user can also choose which types of challenges will be checked). 
- Anti-spoofing settings: Screen reflection detection and missing facial contour detection no longer block liveness detection. 
- Anti-spoofing detection is configured in the metadata under antiSpoofingDetection flags (Anti-Spoofing Result Map), without preventing successful results.
